# Time Series Forecasting with PyTorch LSTM


This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for time series forecasting using PyTorch. The model is designed to predict future values based on historical time series data. Key components include:

- LSTM Model Implementation: A PyTorch-based LSTM network for forecasting.
- Data Preprocessing: Scalers to normalize and inverse-transform data.
- Training and Evaluation: Includes early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Visualization: Tools for plotting predictions against true values.

The project demonstrates end-to-end time series forecasting, from data preparation to model evaluation and result visualization.
